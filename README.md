#NOS 

Narration Overlay System
NOS is a lightweight, trigger-based audio narration system. It allows creators to add scroll-based, hover-based, or element-linked audio narration to any webpage. The system is modular, accessible, and completely local — no server or cloud processing required. Aims to be a multimodal platform for integrated audio experiences accessible to everyone. 


Project structure draft

├── nos.js               ← The runtime library

├── config.json          ← JSON config for scroll/element triggers

├── audio/               ← Folder containing all narration audio clips


The nos.js is included on the page to be narrated

Once linked, NOS will automatically:

-Load config.json
-Register scroll/audio/element triggers
-Play the appropriate audio at the right time or scrub position
-Respect all accessibility settings and only activate when allowed
